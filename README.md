# Overview of the Project

In this project, I am creating a web application with Flask to scarape data from the web for the Mission to Mars. Python is used to customise 
it with HTML and CSS.Bootstap is also used to give the webpage some extra polish.

I have done the below:

- Scraped Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles 
- Updated the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
- Added Bootstap Components
